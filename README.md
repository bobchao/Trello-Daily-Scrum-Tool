[Install this tool from AMO with Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/daily-scrum-tool-for-trello/)

It starts from a small bookmarketlet, then Trello keep change the style so I made this an add-on to solve the update issue.

You can still get the (not updated anymore) bookmarketlet version on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@bobchao/trello-standup-tool).
